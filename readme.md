# Flask Geolocation App 1.0

This application is built in **Python3** with **Flask** (`pip3 install flask`)

Run the project: `python3 server.py` then navigate to: http://localhost:5000

The application will ask for your location. Once you allow this it will send your latitude and longitude to the server which will find the closest pharmacy location to your current position.
